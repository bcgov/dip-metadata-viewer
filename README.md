## dip-metadata-viewer

The DIP Metadata Viewer is web-based, interactive table for viewing and filtering the metadata for data sets available through the [Data Innovation Program (DIP)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/about-data-management/data-innovation-program)&mdash;a data integration and analytics program for the Government of British Columbia. 

The dip-metadata-viewer is built using the [{flexdashboard}](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), [{crosstalk}](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/index.html)  and [{reactable}](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) R packages. All metadata is sourced from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/group/data-innovation-program) using the [{bcdata}](https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/) R package. All the data described in the dip-metadata-viewer is licensed [Access Only](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=1AAACC9C65754E4D89A118B875E0FBDA) and is only available through the [Data Innovation Program](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/about-data-management/data-innovation-program)&mdash;the data is _not_ downloadable from the B.C. Data Catalogue.
